## Overview

The `manuscript` and `Supplementary Material` files can be regenerated in `R` using the library `knitr`. The files themselves use multiple libraries; refer to each file and install the necessary libraries accordingly. To `knit` the final versions of the files we recommend to do it via `RStudio` instead of other IDE/CLI. Information session is included at the end of the `Supplementary Material` to see the version we used for compilation.
