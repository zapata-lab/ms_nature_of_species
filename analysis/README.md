## Overview

This directory includes the directories with all the scripts and commands used to process the raw data and generate intermediate files and final results. Most scripts and commands included here use the files available in the `data` directory. All files are richly annotated to explain all the steps to carry out all analyses. We use CladeI to illustrate how to use the files included here. To run all the analyses for other Clades, modify the inputs accordingly (see each file/script).
