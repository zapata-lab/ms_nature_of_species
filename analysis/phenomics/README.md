## Analysis code

We conducted two analyses with phenotypic data. 

To investigate the sate of taxonomic species using phentoyopic data, run: 

* `state_taxonomic_sp_phenotype.R` This script will estimate n-cubes for all species, quantify overlap of n-cubes in phenospace, conduct matching-prediction analysis, and plot results.

For species discovery using phenotyopic data, run:

* `model_based_spp_discovery_phenotype.R` This script will perform robust PCA, Gaussian Mixture Modeling, and model selection (BIC and ICL)
